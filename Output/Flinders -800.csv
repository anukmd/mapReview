186, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Ancient and falling apart. Needs a great big update including re instating alll platforms and building more. Subway entrances are too narrow and putrid. Food outlets are trashy, expensive and undesirable. We need a good restaurant with views, perhaps using the former ball room."
187, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It's a great hub for trains but it's a stinky dirty place. On one hand there are great food options here for takeaway of every taste but the toilets are honestly for nobody's taste. Platform 13 is a great clandestine find. Lots of places link here. Do yourself a favour and NEVER EVER use the toilets here.
